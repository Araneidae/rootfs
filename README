Rootfs Builder Framework

See docs/html/index.html (after running `make -C docs` if necessary for
details).

This is a framework for building a minimal busybox based root file system.

This can be used in one of two ways:

1.  Check out a local copy and copy or modify an existing configs entry.

2.  Use a publicly installed copy.  The official location is under
        /dls_sw/prod/targetOS/rootfs

When using a fixed copy of rootfs an external configuration can be used by
setting TARGET in the invocation of rootfs thus:

        /dls_sw/prod/targetOS/rootfs/1-0/rootfs make TARGET=$(pwd)/myconfig
