The following components are defined here.

bash
    Web page: http://www.gnu.org/software/bash
    The standard bash shell, but rather large.

busybox
    Web page: http://www.busybox.net/
    Collection of basic utilities.

dropbear
    Web page: http://matt.ucc.asn.au/dropbear/dropbear.html
    Small ssh server and client.

lsof
    Web page: http://people.freebsd.org/~abe/
    Lists all open files.  Rather horrible to configure!

mtd-utils
    Web page: http://www.linux-mtd.infradead.org/source.html
    Download from: ftp://ftp.infradead.org/pub/mtd-utils
    Git repository: git://git.infradead.org/mtd-utils.git 
    Needed for jffs2 support.  We only build flash_eraseall and flashcp.

nano
    Web page: http://www.nano-editor.org/
    Small editor

nfs-utils
    Web page: http://linux-nfs.org and http://nfs.sourceforge.net
    Hopefully to fill in some missing busybox functions for NFS mounts.
    This has been succesfully built (with a surprising amount of effort
    required) but not yet installed or tried.
        If we want to export an nfs filesystem we'll want this.

ntp
    Web page: http://www.ntp.org/
    The definitive NTP clock synchronisation reference implementation.
    Rather large, but very functional.

ntpclient
    Web page: http://doolittle.icarus.com/ntpclient/
    Microscopic ntp client.
    The writer of this also refers to xntpd, and links to a detailed man page,
    but I can't find a download.
    Probably too small to be useful, but here for testing.

openntpd
    Web page: http://www.openntpd.org/
    OpenBSD based implementation of NTP.  Really quite a lot smaller than ntp,
    bit more work to set up, and no status information available when it's 
    running.  This last is not so good...

portmap
    Web page: http://neil.brown.name/portmap/
    Required for nfs lock mounting.

procinfo
    Download from: ftp://ftp.cistron.nl/pub/people/00-OLD/svm/
    Ancient proc monitoring program, last updated 2001-03-02!

procinfo-ng
    Web page: http://sourceforge.net/projects/procinfo-ng/
    Updated proc monitoring program, updated recently, but doesn't look all
    that great.

screen
    Web page: http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/
    Needs an awkward patch to cross compile properly.

strace
    Web page: http://sourceforge.net/projects/strace/
    Invaluable debugging tool.

sudo
    Web page: http://www.gratisoft.us/sudo/
    Controled delegation of authority.

testing
    Example for components with local sources.


These components may be implemented at a later date:

epics
    This is probably normally built separately.

systemtap
    Web page: http://sourceware.org/systemtap/
    Alternative to strace?  Not yet investigated.

tcp_wrappers
    Web page: ftp://ftp.porcupine.org/pub/security/index.html
    Provides libwrap, possibly wanted by nfs-utils.



The components below are appropriate for a basic system:
    busybox         Not optional, unless replaced by something equivalent.
    dropbear        Ssh server.
    ntp/openntpd    One of these is needed to provide NTP synchronisation.
    portmap         Required for NFS locking.
