The following components are defined here.


These components already work:

bash
    Web page: http://www.gnu.org/software/bash
    Maybe to be supported?

busybox
    Web page: http://www.busybox.net/
    Collection of basic utilities.

dropbear
    Web page: http://matt.ucc.asn.au/dropbear/dropbear.html
    Small ssh server and client.

nano
    Web page: http://www.nano-editor.org/
    Small editor

ntp
    Web page: http://www.ntp.org/
    The definitive NTP clock synchronisation reference implementation.
    Rather large, but very functional.

openntpd
    Web page: http://www.openntpd.org/
    OpenBSD based implementation of NTP.  Really quite a lot smaller than ntp,
    bit more work to set up, and no status information available when it's 
    running.  This last is not so good...

portmap
    Web page: http://neil.brown.name/portmap/
    Required for nfs lock mounting.

screen
    Web page: http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/
    Needs an awkward patch to cross compile properly.

strace
    Web page: http://sourceforge.net/projects/strace/
    Invaluable debugging tool.


These components may be implemented at a later date:

cron
    The big puzzle about cron is *which* version?
    1. Debian: uses Vixie Cron, version 3.0pl1.  Can't find canonical web site
       for this version, but `apt-get source cron` fetches the Debian version.
       Linux From Scratch also have patches to Vixie Cron, see:
        http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/patches/browser/trunk/vixie-cron
    2. Open embedded fetches 
        http://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/daemons/cron/cronr8.tar.gz
       together with a few patches.  Unfortunately that is out of date.  The
       directory http://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/daemons/cron/ contains a
       variety of crons, including 3.0pl1.
    3. FreeBSD and OpenBSD have their own versions of cron, but lets ignore
       those (porting would be crazy).
    4. ISC Cron can be downloaded from http://ftp.isc.org/isc/cron/ as a
       "shell archive" -- this is version 4.1, described by Wikipedia as
       version 4 of Vixie cron.
    Actually, cron is provided by crosstool, so there's not much point in
    spending any more time on it.

epics
    This is probably normally built separately.

nfs-utils
    Web page: http://linux-nfs.org and http://nfs.sourceforge.net
    Hopefully to fill in some missing busybox functions for NFS mounts.

systemtap
    Web page: http://sourceware.org/systemtap/
    Alternative to strace?  Not yet investigated.

tcp_wrappers
    Web page: ftp://ftp.porcupine.org/pub/security/index.html
    Provides libwrap, needed by nfs-utils.
