The following components are defined here.


These components already work:

bash
    Web page: http://www.gnu.org/software/bash
    Maybe to be supported?

busybox
    Web page: http://www.busybox.net/
    Collection of basic utilities.

dropbear
    Web page: http://matt.ucc.asn.au/dropbear/dropbear.html
    Small ssh server and client.

nano
    Web page: http://www.nano-editor.org/
    Small editor

ntp
    Web page: http://www.ntp.org/
    The definitive NTP clock synchronisation reference implementation.
    Rather large, but very functional.

openntpd
    Web page: http://www.openntpd.org/
    OpenBSD based implementation of NTP.  Really quite a lot smaller than ntp,
    bit more work to set up, and no status information available when it's 
    running.  This last is not so good...

portmap
    Web page: http://neil.brown.name/portmap/
    Required for nfs lock mounting.

strace
    Web page: http://sourceforge.net/projects/strace/
    Invaluable debugging tool.


These components may be implemented at a later date:

nfs-utils
    Web page: http://linux-nfs.org and http://nfs.sourceforge.net
    Hopefully to fill in some missing busybox functions for NFS mounts.

systemtap
    Web page: http://sourceware.org/systemtap/
    Alternative to strace?  Not yet investigated.

tcp_wrappers
    Web page: ftp://ftp.porcupine.org/pub/security/index.html
    Provides libwrap, needed by nfs-utils.

screen
    Web page: http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/
    Won't damned well configure for cross compilation!
