# Network configuration from canned files with management script.
#
# This provides one (optional) startup script, mount-extra, for mounting NFS
# mounts, and a network configuration script, configure-network, for switching
# between networks.
#
# The basic network configuration consists of the following definitions:
#
#   NETWORKS_LIST
#       A list of networks, each line of the form:
#           <network-name> <netmask> [<gateway>]
#
#   RESOLV_CONF.<network-name>
#       For each network name the appropriate resolv.conf file to use.
#
#   IP_LIST.<network-name>
#       For each network name a list of machine names and associated IP
#       addresses for that network.
#
# Optionally extra network specific mounts can be configured with the following
# definitions:
#
#   MOUNT_EXTRA
#       List of mount points to be created.  If this is not set then mount-extra
#       is not installed.
#
#   FSTAB.<network-name>
#       For each network name the appropiate fstab for extra mounts.
#
# Also, if HOSTNAME is specified then it will be selected on startup.
