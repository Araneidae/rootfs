General Notes
=============

Booting from an NFS root filesystem
-----------------------------------

Notes on this here: http://www.faqs.org/docs/Linux-HOWTO/Diskless-root-NFS-other-HOWTO.html#ss4.1[].

Kernel configuration:
 * Build in support for the cient 's network card (Network device support ---> Select your card driver).
 * Build in support for the BOOTP protocol (Networking options ---> IP: kernel level autoconfiguration ---> IP: BOOTP support).
 * Build in support for NFS and root over NFS (File systems ---> Network File Systems ---> NFS file system support and File systems ---> Network File Systems ---> NFS file system support ---> Root over NFS).
 * Build in support for loopback devices (Block devices ---> Loopback device support).


Building with `-mthumb`
-----------------------

    bash        23% smaller
    busybox     26% smaller
    dropbear    17% smaller     But too slow!
    mtd-utils   
    nano        25% smaller
    nologin     
    ntp         21% smaller
    openntpd    21% smaller
    portmap     7%  smaller
    screen      27% smaller
    strace      16% smaller

We don't use `-mthumb` with dropbear: although the size improvement is
worthwhile, the performance reduction is significant: 
    `time ssh $machine true`
reports 1.3 seconds using thumb, 0.5 with standard architecture!
